This is a simple website format and hopefully you guys can take this and build on it
Welcome to Marioclub!

This repository is dedicated to all things Mario. Whether you're a fan of the classic games or the newer versions, this is the place to share your projects, ideas, and thoughts about the iconic plumber and his world.

One of the main goals of this repository is to provide inspiration and resources for developers who want to create their own Mario-themed websites or projects. Here, you'll find a collection of images, sounds, and other resources related to Mario that you can use to create your own versions of websites, games, and more.

Feel free to contribute your own Mario-themed projects, artwork, or fan-fiction, and connect with other fans in the community. Let's make Marioclub the ultimate destination for Mario lovers and developers alike!

We look forward to seeing what you create and sharing in the fun of all things Mario.

Happy hacking!
